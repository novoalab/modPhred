# modPhred data

Here you can download the models that were used in the manuscript. 

## DNA model: dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_dam-dcm-cpg_hac.tar.gz

This model is originally distributed with guppy ver. 3.6.1,
but it can be used with all newer guppy version.
We provide this model here because it's not present
in the newer version of guppy (starting from 4.5.1). 

## RNA model: rna_r9.4.1_70bps_m6A-m5C-5hmC_hac.tar.gz 

This model can recognise m6A, m5C and 5hmC in all sequence contexts. 
It has been trained with *in vitro* transcribed molecules
in which either all bases are modified or all are unmodified,
and because of that it isnâ€™t applicable to biological samples
in which only some bases are expected to be modified.

You can find more details in the supplementary information of the manuscript.
