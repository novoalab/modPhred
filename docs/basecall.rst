Basecalling
===========

Basecalling is performed using guppy basecaller.
You can choose to either: 

- basecall Fast5 before (guppy ver. >3.2 is supported)
- or run live basecalling (guppy ver. >3.6 is supported)

Note, if you choose choose to run live basecalling, you'll need to 
:ref:`install matching version of pyguppyclient <install.html#which-pyguppyclient-version-should-i-install>`.
